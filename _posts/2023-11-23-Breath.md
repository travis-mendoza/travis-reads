My friend Maggi instructed me to breathe only through my nose during one of our more shivery walks in Vail last winter. It’s a trick she learned from this book to help regulate body temperature and it worked; I warmed up and stayed out longer. Impressed, I thought I better read the book, too, to see if there were any other life-hacks I could get from it. This is what I learned.

# Main arguments of the book
_No matter what we eat, how much we exercise, how resilient our genes are, how skinny or young or wise we are—none of it will matter unless we’re breathing correctly._

---
_nasal breathing is far more healthy and efficient than breathing through the mouth._

---
_The key to optimum breathing, and all the health, endurance, and longevity benefits that come with it, is to practice fewer inhales and exhales in a smaller volume. To breathe, but to breathe less._


# Why the nose offers superior breath
_the \[nose\] will heat, clean, slow, \[moisturize\] and pressurize air so that the lungs can extract more oxygen with each breath._

---
_The interior of the nose, it turned out, is blanketed with erectile tissue, the same flesh that covers the penis, clitoris, and nipples._

And if that doesn’t get you riled up to breathe through your noise, I’m not sure what will.

---
_Mouthbreathing causes the body to lose 40 percent more water._
